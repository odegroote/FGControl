# FGControl
Arduino UNO program to control two AD9833 DDS functiongenerators

This program is based on a rotary encoder (with switch ) with which the user can change 
settings of two AD9833 DDS functiongenerators. The currently supported settings 
are:

	enable/disable
	waveform
	frequency
	
The settings for the two AD9833 are displayed on a NOKIA 5110 display.

Navigation on the display to select which setting to change is done using the button
on the encoder.
